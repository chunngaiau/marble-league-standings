# Marble League 2020 Standings Probabilities

The `winning_probabilities.ipynb` notebook contains the code to estimate the standings probabilities throughout the 2020 marble league. The probabilities are estimated for:

1. The championship position (i.e. ranked 1st)
2. The podium position (i.e. ranked top 3)
3. Above 50th percentile (i.e. ranked top 8)
4. Last position

The probabilities are estimated using a uniform probability Monte Carlo method and a beta-distribution method that takes into account the teams' performance during the league.

The notebooks uses embedded HTML graphs so using GitHub's default viewer will not work.
